# Secrets

Secrets is an web app where you can leave your secrets anonymously, you can either create an account or access with Google/ Facebook authentication. I use Node.js, Express.js to build the app, installing social media authentication with passport module, using MongoDB Atlas to restore the database, finally deploy on Heroku.
